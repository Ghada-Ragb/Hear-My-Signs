Application Hear My Signs
"This project aims to assist deaf and mute individuals in effectively communicating with the surrounding community. Our application consists of four main components:

1. **Sign language education:** The app provides comprehensive lessons to teach the basics of Arabic and English sign language, starting from the alphabet to forming sentences and expressing complex ideas. It features an interactive design that allows users to practice signs and receive feedback, improving their skills gradually.

2. **Speech-to-sign language translation:** Users can input any written text, and the app will automatically translate it into sign language and display it visually. Additionally, users can speak into the app, which will convert speech to text and then to sign language, providing a more interactive experience.

3. **Video-to-sign language translation:** Users can upload any video, and the app will analyze the video content and translate it into sign language. This helps deaf and mute individuals understand the content of various videos, such as news, educational programs, and entertainment.

4. **Sign language-to-speech translation:** Users can sign in front of the device's camera, and the app will convert the signs into text and then into spoken language, enabling communication with people who do not know sign language.

The project's significance lies in empowering deaf and mute individuals, facilitating communication, promoting inclusivity, and utilizing cutting-edge technologies in natural language processing and sign language recognition."
